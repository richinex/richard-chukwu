**Plexisort** is a command-line tool designed to organize your files based on metadata. It allows for flexible source and destination directory settings, supports dry-run operations for safe previews of potential changes, and even offers an undo functionality for reversing the last set of file movements.

## Motivation

The Plexisort project began out of necessity and curiosity. Like many, I was grappling with a cluttered Downloads folder, consisting of files accumulated over time. This clutter made it difficult to locate important documents. I also had quite a lot of images and wanted to organize them by date.
<br />
<br />
At about the same time, I started to learn Rust, and I was eager to put my newfound power to the test. Plexisort emerged as the perfect project to address both my personal need for a cleaner digital workspace and my professional desire to become better at Rust.
<br />
<br />
In sharing Plexisort, I hope to not only provide a solution to a common problem but also inspire others to embark on their own learning journeys. Whether it's tackling digital clutter or learning a new programming language, the essence of Plexisort is about embracing challenges and turning them into opportunities for growth.
