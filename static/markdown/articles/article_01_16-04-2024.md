# What are some very good resources to learn Rust? {#welcome-id .welcome-class key="value"}

Rust is a systems programming language well known for its focus on performance, memory safety, zero-cost abstractions, and a steep learning curve.
There are quite a lot of concepts and syntax that can trip a beginner. For instance, how do you read the code below:

<br />

`impl<T> Queue<T> {}`

<br />

Why do we need to add static in the signature of the function?

<br />

```rust {#code-id .code-class}
fn check_grade(grade: i32) -> &'static str {
    match grade {
        90..=100 => "A",
        80..=89 => "B",
        70..=79 => "C",
        60..=69 => "D",
        0..=59 => "F",
        _ => "Invalid grade",
    }
}

```
